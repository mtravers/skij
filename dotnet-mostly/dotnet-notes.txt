Problems with Skij on .NET

- getGraphics returns an object that can't be accessed through reflection, which breaks
anything that does drawing.

- resources need to be packaged (kludged around by going to filesystem)

- How to load an Assembly:

(invoke-static 'System.Reflection.Assembly 'LoadFrom
   "c:/WINNT/assembly/GAC/System.Windows.Forms/1.0.3300.0__b77a5c561934e089/System.Windows.Forms.dll")

This should work, but doesn't:
(invoke-static 'System.Reflection.Assembly 'Load "System.Windows.Forms")

(new 'System.Windows.Forms.Form) etc.

- Properties are handled by set_Foo and get_Foo methods. This makes describe work right!

- Enumerations can be accessed like this:
  (peek-static 'System.Net.Sockets.AddressFamily 'AppleTalk)

(new 'System.Net.Sockets.Socket 
         (peek-static 'System.Net.Sockets.AddressFamily 'InterNetwork)
         (peek-static 'System.Net.Sockets.SocketType 'Stream)
         (peek-static 'System.Net.Sockets.ProtocolType 'Tcp))

- for events, see: ms-help://MS.VSCC/MS.VJSharp/dv_vjsharp/html/vjgrfUsingEvents.htm
(may need to do this in Vis Studio, maybe not)

- backtraces never go below the Java level (that is, Dynvoke)
  There is a System.Diagnostics.StackTrace class, but I don't think I can access it very easily
  You can call fillInStackTrace on the java exception object, and it actually adds some stuff,
  but only up to the .NET reflection classes....argh
