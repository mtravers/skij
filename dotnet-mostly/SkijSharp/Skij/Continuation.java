/**
 * A continuation is a procedure that represents an execution state captured
 * via <code>call-with-current-continuation</code>.
 * When applied, it throws a <code>ContinuationException</code> to perform
 * a transfer of control. Thus a continuation can only be used inside the
 * dynamic context in which it was created (this is a limitation of Skij;
 * full-strength Scheme implementation can re-enter continuations even after
 * their dynamic context has been exited from.
