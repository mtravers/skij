Welcome to WebSpect</H1>
You are talking to a remote Java Virtual Machine that is running a WebSpect
server.. WebSpect allows you to inspect, create, and manipulate the Java
objects that live in this machine through your web browser.

What's going on?</H3>
The server machine (<A HREF="http://gumby.watson.ibm.com:2341/webspect/inspect?object=0&uid=gumby.watson.ibm.com8902616">gumby.watson.ibm.com/9.2.8.91</A>)
is running a Java VM, which is running a <A HREF="http://w3,watson.ibm.com/~mt/skij">Skij</A>
interpreter, which is running the WebSpect server. Skij includes extensions
to the standard&nbsp; Java Reflection APIs that permit arbitrary interactive
creation and manipulation of Java objects. Webspect creates a web-based
interface to this capability. If you don't mind parentheses, you can access
this capability more directly by running Skij on your own machine. Skij
can live alongside other Java applications and can be used as a debugging
and scripting tool.
<H3>
What's the point?</H3>
You may have noticed that there has been revolution in computer interfaces
that's been going on for a couple of decades now.&nbsp; Beginning&nbsp;
with Doug Englebart's Augment wor, and continuing on through the Xerox
Star, Macintosh, and Windows, the thrust bof this revolution has to make
computational objects appear as graphic objects in the interface and allow
users to perform operations on them through direct manipulation.

<P>To some extent, this revolution has bypassed programmers, who are most
in need of it, since they deal with more complex systems of objects than
most users. Nonetheless, most programmers have very poor access to what's
going on in their computation. The exceptions have been confined to programming
environments based on dynamic languages like Smalltalk and Lisp, which
make reflective tools easy to implement,.

<P>Now comes Java, which has some but not all of the capacity for dynamic
reflection found in Lisp or Smalltalk. Can tools be built that give Java
more powerful reflection? Yes, that's what I've been doing. Skij shows
that the Java reflection API can be extended to allow fully dynamic method
calling. WebSpect builds on this by providing a graphic interface to this
capability, albeit not an ideal one. Skij itself constiutes an interface,
although one that most programmers won't use. Other interfaces are planned.
<H3>
Who is responsible?</H3>
WebSpect and Skij are the creations of <A HREF="http://w3.watson.ibm.com/~mt">Michael
Travers</A> who works in the <A HREF="http://w3.research.ibm.com/JavaTools/">Java
Tools Group</A> at the <A HREF="http://w3.watson.ibm.com">IBM T.J Watson
Research Center</A>. Special thanks to Christopher Fry for feedback and
encouragement.
