This Java applet lets you make patterns out of pattern blocks, a
traditional educational manipulative.  Why should you do this on a
computer rather than with the nice wooden blocks you can buy?  The
main reason is that the program includes a <b>group</b> command, which
provides a form of <b>recursive composition</b> -- you can combine a
few blocks to define a new block, which you can then clone, rotate,
and otherwise manipulate to make a larger structure. This makes it
easy to build up large patterns fast, and also lets you come up with
interesting patterns through exploration.

The user interface for Patblocks is a little idiosyncratic, so here's 
a suggestion for getting started:

The Text-buttons at the botton put PatBlocks in a mode -- Drag,
Rotate, Group, Clone, and Delete.  Drag is the default.  In Drag mode, you 
can also use the right mouse button to rotate.

The Group button is a little tricky. To make a group --
- arrange the blocks as you like
- click on the group button
- click on the blocks you want to include in the group (their border will turn white)
- when done, click on group again to form the group
- now the group will move and clone as (you guessed it) a group)




Feep.
