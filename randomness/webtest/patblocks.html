<h1>Pattern Blocks</h1>

<p>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">

Pattern blocks are a traditional educational "manipulative" that
allows students to explore geometrical patterns.  

Why should you do this on a computer rather than with the nice,
tactile, easily available wooden blocks?  The main reason is that the
program includes a <b>group</b> command, which makes it much easier to
build large patterns.  The group command lets you group a set of
blocks into a configuration that becomes a new block that you can
clone, rotate, and otherwise manipulate to make a larger
structure. This makes it easy to build up large patterns fast, and
also lets you come up with interesting patterns through exploration.

The user interface for Patblocks is a little idiosyncratic, so here's 
a suggestion for getting started:
<p>
You can always drag out new blocks from the blocks on the left edge of the screen.  You
probably want to avoid the pentagon and octagon, at least to start.
<p>
The buttons at the top of the window put PatBlocks in a <i>mode</i> -- <b>Drag</b>,
<b>Rotate</b>, <b>Group</b>, <b>Clone</b>, or <b>Delete</b>.  Drag is the default.  In Drag mode, you 
can also use the right mouse button to rotate.
<p>
The Group button is a little tricky. To make a group --
<ul>
<li>arrange the blocks as you like
<li>click on the group button
<li>click on the blocks you want to include in the group (their border will turn white)
<li>when done, click on group again to form the group
<li>the group appears in the palette, and the originals are removed from the main screen
</ul>
<p>
The <b>Window</b> button moves the pattern block program out of the web page and into its own window,
so that it can be enlarged for bigger and better patterns. 
<p>
One handy hidden feature: in Drag mode, dragging with the right mouse button will actually do a
rotate operation.
