Dear Dave,

Hi, it's been awhile. I hope you and Jikes and the rest of Watson are
doing well.

I'm writing to try to revive some old software and old licensing
issues.  There's a number of projects out there that want to use Skij,
the Java-based Scheme implementation I developed while at
Watson. However, the licensing imposed by alphaWorks has been a
barrier. I tried a long time ago to get it moved to an open source
license, but there wasn't enough interest from IBM. Since then, of
course, IBM has embraced Linux and open source, so the rules might
have changed.

I'm wondering who I should talk to try again, and thought I'd write to
you since I remember you were in the forefront of this kind of thing
at IBM.  If you know of anybody, I'd really appreciate it if you could
send me some contact info, or if you like you can forward this
message.

Anyway, thanks for any help,

Mike Travers

PS: I just noticed that Skij has been "retired" from the alphaWorks
website and is no longer available at all.  This must have happened
fairly recently.  I'll interpret this to mean IBM has no further
interest in it, so it might as well be made available somehow.
