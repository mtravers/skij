- Watson database is not updated very well; is there some way to get
at Austin's?

- popup menus are sort of iffy even aside from Swing problems

- interface: separate out user input, output, and header text

- refresh is broken in Swing under Netscape
   kludge fix:
   (in-own-process (loop (sleep 1) (invoke <frame> 'repaint))) 

- for applet
-- package in JApplet
-- some sort of web interface (personal URLs and callup pages)
--

- server has to be same as web server (so either: 
   -- web server on gumby
   -- run call server on w3.

- need a user interface for entering initial (and subsequent) names
-   and handling of multiple or missing names
     DONE, to first cut
- would be nice if name appeared first, before getting all superiors...
     working on it...mostly DONE

- mystery Swing errors (from repaint)

; make updates happen in separate thread (add synchronizers, see node doc)
    DONE
; clicks on open/close bring up menu; shouldn't
; click on non-item gets error
; item display problem

; better error handling
;  command interface
;  display more fields, ie, mail address, web page
; might be nice if you didn't HAVE to go all the way up to Gerstner
; take manager field to indicate whether their are subordinates?
; cache subordinate info
; change to Swing tree widget, eventually
; interesting: "department" is not the same as "has same manager".
;   ok, cow-orkers of a manager will only give you mgr plus subordinates who aren't managers

; show web-page, make clickable. Also email and/or phone

; there is some way to get department names, and they ARE useful...let's figure it out
;  OK here it is: -T adds the "pseudo-column" department title (only when used with -c)
;    HOWEVER, it fucks up with managers! weird, weird, weird
; doing Mark Lucente included some sibling departments for reasons unknown
; why does it close old entries when adding new ones?
; better icons; indicate managers even if subordinates aren't included
; redisplay must be incremental
;   DONE, may cause breakage
;and manager icons should indicate if they are being worked on...


- needs to handle multiple returned entries (or failed name lookup) better
   DONE
