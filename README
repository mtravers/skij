Skij is a fairly ancient Java-based Scheme interpreter, developed at IBM in 1997/1998. Included here on Github mostly for historic and didactic purposes -- there are much better choices for Lisp-like languages and interpreted languages on the JVM these days.

To start:
> java -classpath skij.jar com.ibm.jikes.skij.Scheme
